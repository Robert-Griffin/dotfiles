# dotfiles

Run the rakefile and symbolic links will be created between the system/_* files and their counterparts in your home directory. For example system/_vimrc creates `~/.vimrc -> /path/to/dotfiles/system/_vimrc`

WARNING: The changes are destructive so be sure to backup your corresponding dotfiles in your home directory.
